However, AMR does not represent scope information, posing a problem for its overall expressivity and specifically for drawing inferences from negated statements. This is the case with so-called {``}positive interpretations{''} of negated statements, in which implicit positive meaning is identified by inferring the opposite of the negation{'}s focus. In this work, we investigate how potential positive interpretations (PPIs) can be represented in AMR. We propose a logically motivated AMR structure for PPIs that makes the focus of negation explicit and sketch an initial proposal for a systematic methodology to generate this more expressive structure.",

Nevertheless, how semantics is understood in NLP ranges from traditional, formal linguistic definitions based on logic and the principle of compositionality to more applied notions based on grounding meaning in real-world objects and real-time interaction. ``Semantic'' methods may additionally strive for meaningful representation of language that integrates broader aspects of human cognition and embodied experience, calling into question how adequate a representation of meaning based on linguistic signal alone is for current research agendas. We review the state of computational semantics in NLP and investigate how different lines of inquiry reflect distinct understandings of semantics and prioritize different layers of linguistic meaning. In conclusion, we identify several important goals of the field and describe how current research addresses them.},

We develop a model of Bayesian Dynamic Pragmatics [26], and propose an algorithm for how the use of a politeness-oriented marker contributes to the dynamic creation of the speaker's persona or publicized self-image. Our model captures multiple pragmatic factors that impact politeness-usage and persona simultaneously. As such, it is designed to be extended and explain comparable phenomena in other languages that employ politeness-oriented expressions.},

  We outline an extended model generation calculus that solves the most unpleasant
  computational inadequacy; In the extended calculus, tableau expansion rules are
  equipped with costs, and model construction is a process that optimizes model
  quality under resource constraints with respect to these costs. We embed the
  new calculus into an abstract inference machine and illustrate the possibilities
  of this approach by presenting a partial theory of definite descriptions in this setting.
  
  In this case study, the constants in the universe are given saliences, that are
  maintained across the model generation process. This additional data serves as
  one important source of information for model quality and resource cost
  estimation.},

  profit from the advances in planner expressiveness and

  readily handle the search problems that arise in our NLG
  experiments, their overall runtime is often dominated by the
  grounding step they perform as preprocessing.  Furthermore, small
  changes in the structure of a domain can significantly shift the
  balance between search and preprocessing.  Overall, our experiments
  show that the off-the-shelf planners we tested are unusably slow for
  nontrivial NLG problem instances. As a result, we offer our domains

context that can evolve dynamically over the course of an
interaction. On this basis, we propose a computational model of
effective reference generation which distinguishes speaker behavior
according to its helpfulness to the hearer in a certain situation,
and explicitly aims at modeling highly helpful speaker behavior rather
than speaker behavior invariably. Our model, which extends the
planning-based paradigm of sentence generation with a statistical
account of effectiveness, can adapt to the situational context by
making this distinction newly for each new reference. We find that the
generated references resemble those of effective human speakers more
closely than references of baseline models, and that they are
resolved correctly more often than those of other models participating
in a shared-task evaluation with human hearers. Finally, we argue
that the model could serve as a methodological framework for
computational and empirical research on referential effectiveness.},

In this paper, we investigate whether a speaker may, in principle, exploit listener gaze to improve communicative success. In the context of a virtual environment where listeners follow computer-generated instructions, we provide two kinds of support for this claim. Firstly, we show that listener gaze provides a reliable real-time index of understanding even in dynamic and complex environments, and on a per-utterance basis. Secondly, we show that a language generation system that uses listener gaze to provide rapid feedback improves overall task performance in comparison with two systems that do not use gaze. Beyond demonstrating the utility of listener gaze in situated communication, our findings open the door to new methods for developing and evaluating multi-modal models of situated interaction.}

Reconciling both of these qualities requires the careful exploration of a novel design space; we also review some recent results that may help in this exploration. }

orders of magnitude better than that of the original FF, and for the

First, we statically analyze the semantic dependency graphs, seeking to unscover which linguistic phenomena in particular require the additional annotation expressivity provided by moving from trees to graphs. We focus on undirected base cycles in the SDP graphs, and discover strong connections to grammatical control and coordination. Second, we make use of the approximations in a statistical parsing scenario. In it, we convert the training set graphs to dependency trees, and use the resulting treebanks to build standard dependency tree parsers. We perform lossy graph reconstructions on parser outputs, and evaluate our models as dependency graph parsers. Our system outperforms the baselines by a large margin, and evaluates as the best non-voting tree approximation--based parser on the SemEval 2014 data, scoring at just over 81\% in labeled F1.},

We present new evidence that this is a general limitation of seq2seq models that is present not just in semantic parsing, but also in syntactic parsing and in text-to-text tasks, and that this limitation can often be overcome by neurosymbolic models that have linguistic knowledge built in.

AMR is a general-purpose meaning representation that has become popular for its transparent structure, its ease of annotation and available corpora, and its overall expressiveness. While AMR was designed to represent meaning in language as text or speech, gesture accompanying speech conveys a number of novel communicative dimensions, including situational reference, spatial locations, manner, attitude, orientation, backchanneling, and others. In this paper, we explore how to combine multimodal elements into a single representation for alignment and grounded meaning, using gesture as a case study. As a platform for multimodal situated dialogue annotation, we believe that Gesture AMR has several attractive properties. It is adequately expressive at both utterance and dialogue levels, while easily accommodating the structures inherent in gestural expressions. Further, the native reentrancy facilitates both the linking between modalities and the eventual situational grounding to contextual bindings.},

In developing Gesture AMR, we consider how gesture form and meaning relate; how gesture packages meaning both independently and in interaction with speech; and how the meaning of gesture is temporally and contextually determined. Our case study for developing Gesture AMR is a focused human-human shared task to build block structures. We develop an initial taxonomy of gesture act relations that adheres to AMR{'}s existing focus on predicate-argument structure while integrating meaningful elements unique to gesture. Pilot annotation shows Gesture AMR to be more challenging than standard AMR, and illustrates the need for more work on representation of dialogue and multimodal meaning. We discuss challenges of adapting an existing meaning representation to non-speech-based modalities and outline several avenues for expanding Gesture AMR.",

Existing benchmarks often focus on lexical generalization, the interpretation of novel lexical items in syntactic structures familiar from training; structural generalization tasks, where a model needs to interpret syntactic structures that are themselves unfamiliar from training, are often underrepresented, resulting in overly optimistic perceptions of how well models can generalize. We introduce SLOG, a semantic parsing dataset that extends COGS (Kim and Linzen, 2020) with 17 structural generalization cases. In our experiments, the generalization accuracy of Transformer models, including pretrained ones, only reaches 40.6{\%}, while a structure-aware parser only achieves 70.8{\%}. These results are far from the near-perfect accuracy existing models achieve on COGS, demonstrating the role of SLOG in foregrounding the large discrepancy between models{'} lexical and structural generalization capacities.",

Managing ambiguity is a key part of human language understanding, allowing us to anticipate misunderstanding as communicators and revise our interpretations as listeners.

We capture ambiguity in a sentence through its effect on entailment relations with another sentence, and collect AmbiEnt, a linguist-annotated benchmark of 1,645 examples with diverse kinds of ambiguity. We design a suite of tests based on AmbiEnt, presenting the first evaluation of pretrained LMs to recognize ambiguity and disentangle possible meanings. We find that the task remains extremely challenging, including for GPT-4, whose generated disambiguations are considered correct only 32{\%} of the time in crowdworker evaluation, compared to 90{\%} for disambiguations in our dataset. Finally, to illustrate the value of ambiguity-sensitive tools, we show that a multilabel NLI model can flag political claims in the wild that are misleading due to ambiguity. We encourage the field to rediscover the importance of ambiguity for NLP.",

It can be implemented efficiently using constraint programming (CP; Koller and Niehren 2002).  In
the CP context, parsing is cast as a search problem: The states of the search are partial parse trees, successful end states are complete and valid parses.

In this paper, we propose a probability model for XDG dependency trees and an A-Star search control regime for the XDG parsing algorithm that guarantees the best parse to be found first.  Extending XDG with a statistical component has the benefit of bringing the formalism further into the grammatical mainstream; it also enables XDG to efficiently deal with large, corpus-induced grammars that come with a high degree of ambiguity.},

  in the framework of CLLS, where underspecified representations are

  introduce some novel properties of dominance constraints and present
  a safety criterion that ensures that an underspecified description
  can be relaxed without adding unwanted readings. We then apply this
  criterion systematically to Egg's analysis and show 
  why its relaxation operation does not lead to overgeneration.},

AMR offers a valuable level of abstraction of the propositional content of an utterance; however, it does not capture the illocutionary force or speaker{'}s intended contribution in the broader dialogue context (e.g., make a request or ask a question), nor does it capture tense or aspect. We explore dialogue in the domain of human-robot interaction, where a conversational robot is engaged in search and navigation tasks with a human partner. To address the limitations of standard AMR, we develop an inventory of speech acts suitable for our domain, and present {``}Dialogue-AMR{''}, an enhanced AMR that represents not only the content of an utterance, but the illocutionary force behind it, as well as tense and aspect. To showcase the coverage of the schema, we use both manual and automatic methods to construct the {``}DialAMR{''} corpus{---}a corpus of human-robot dialogue annotated with standard AMR and our enriched Dialogue-AMR schema. Our automated methods can be used to incorporate AMR into a larger NLU pipeline supporting human-robot dialogue.",

We present a two-level annotation scheme for modality that captures both content and intent, integrating a logic-based, semantic representation and a task-oriented, pragmatic representation that maps to our robot{'}s capabilities. Data from our annotation task reveals that the interpretation of modal expressions in human-robot dialogue is quite diverse, yet highly constrained by the physical environment and asymmetrical speaker/addressee relationship. We sketch a formal model of human-robot common ground in which modality can be grounded and dynamically interpreted.",

Nevertheless, AMR lacks a systematic treatment of projection phenomena, making its translation into logical form problematic. We present a translation function from AMR to first order logic using continuation semantics, which allows us to capture the semantic context of an expression in the form of an argument. This is a natural extension of AMR{'}s original design principles, allowing us to easily model basic projection phenomena such as quantification and negation as well as complex phenomena such as bound variables and donkey anaphora.",

Multilingual models adapted to the financial domain would ease deployment when an organization needs to work with multiple languages on a regular basis. For the development and evaluation of such models, there is a need for multilingual financial language processing datasets. We describe MultiFin {--} a publicly available financial dataset consisting of real-world article headlines covering 15 languages across different writing systems and language families. The dataset consists of hierarchical label structure providing two classification tasks: multi-label and multi-class. We develop our annotation schema based on a real-world application and annotate our dataset using both {`}label by native-speaker{'} and {`}translate-then-label{'} approaches. The evaluation of several popular multilingual models, e.g., mBERT, XLM-R, and mT5, show that although decent accuracy can be achieved in high-resource languages, there is substantial room for improvement in low-resource languages.",
