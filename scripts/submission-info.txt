0.3.0

Pergamon is a package for typesetting bibliographies in Typst. It is inspired by BibLaTeX, in that the way in which it typesets bibliographies can be easily customized through Typst code.

Version 0.3.0 adds improved support for nontrivial names, support for calling Typst functions when rendering Bibtex entries, and the ability to continue counting up reference indices across bibliographies.

Description: Explain what the package does and why it's useful.

Pergamon is a package for typesetting bibliographies in Typst. It is inspired by BibLaTeX, in that  the way in which it typesets bibliographies can be easily customized through Typst code. Like Typst's regular bibliography management model, Pergamon can be configured to use different styles for typesetting references and citations; unlike it, these styles are all defined through Typst code, rather than CSL.

Pergamon has a number of advantages over the builtin Typst bibliographies:

- Pergamon styles are simply pieces of Typst code and can be easily configured or modified.
- The document can be easily split into different refsections, each of which can have its own bibliography (similar to [Alexandria](https://typst.app/universe/package/alexandria/)).
- Paper titles can be automatically made into hyperlinks - as in [blinky](https://typst.app/universe/package/blinky/), but much more flexibly and correctly.
- Bibliographies can be filtered, and bibliography entries programmatically highlighted, which is useful e.g. for CVs.
- References retain nonstandard Bibtex fields (unlike in Hayagriva), making it e.g. possible to split bibliographies based on keywords.
